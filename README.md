# -HolA-Bot
In this theme, the teams will build a HolA Bot for deployment in an arena which is an abstraction of different settings in a Smart City. To enable the robot to do more complex art, the teams will explore an exciting type of mobile locomotion, known as Holonomic Drive. Unlike the usual, more popular differential drive robots, the holonomic drive robots can control all the three degrees of freedom possible on a plane (translation along the x, y-axis and rotation along the z-axis). This gives the robot the ability to make art that would otherwise not be possible with the usual two-wheeled differential drive robot.
